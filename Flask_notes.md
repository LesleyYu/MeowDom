run directly. But has to re-run the app everytime we make changes
```
cd flaskblog
export FLASK_APP=flaskblog.py
flask run
```
We can use `export FLASK_DEBUG=1` instead of `export FLASK_APP=flaskblog.py` to enable auto-refresh.

Alternatively after we stated `if __name__ == '__main__':` we can use `python` to run it.

* A hard refresh: command + shift + R *
